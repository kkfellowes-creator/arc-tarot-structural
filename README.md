# ARC Tarot – Structural Archive

Public archive: system architecture and documentation for ARC Tarot (Planetary Field Version).

This repository serves as the formal public archive for ARC Tarot.

The deck is treated here as a structural system rather than a symbolic or divinatory instrument. 

Cards are catalogued as they are publicly disclosed.

Each archived entry includes:

* Image
* Structural classification (Current / Major / Special)
* Descriptive text
* Date of first disclosure

The Perimeter document provides architectural orientation to the system as a whole.
